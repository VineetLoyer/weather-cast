### **WeatherCast Data Pipeline**

---

#### **Milestone 1: Define Requirements and Setup**

* **Objective** : Understand the project scope and set up foundational tools and services.
* **Steps** :

1. Finalize the data sources (e.g., OpenWeatherMap API).
2. Register and obtain API keys for the chosen weather API.
3. Set up a GitHub repository for version control.
4. Decide on the cloud provider (AWS, GCP, or Azure) for hosting and deployment.
5. Prepare your local development environment:
   * Install Python and required libraries (`requests`, `pandas`, `boto3`, `kafka-python`, etc.).
   * Set up a virtual environment (e.g., `venv` or `conda`).

#### **Milestone 2: Build Data Ingestion Pipeline**

* **Objective** : Implement a pipeline to fetch and stream weather data.
* **Steps** :

1. Write a Python script to fetch weather data from the API for a single location.
2. Extend the script to handle multiple locations and collect data every 15 minutes.
3. Integrate Apache Kafka for real-time streaming:
   * Set up Kafka locally or in the cloud.
   * Publish weather data to Kafka topics.
4. Test and debug the ingestion process.

* **Deliverable** : A working ingestion pipeline that streams data into Kafka topics.

---

#### **Milestone 3: Set Up Data Storage**

* **Objective** : Store raw and processed data for easy access and querying.
* **Steps** :

1. Create an S3 bucket (or GCS equivalent) for raw data storage.
2. Write a Python script to upload raw JSON responses to the bucket.
3. Set up PostgreSQL (or MySQL) for structured data storage.
4. Configure MongoDB for semi-structured metadata.
5. Test data ingestion and storage integration.

* **Deliverable** : A functioning storage setup with raw and structured data stored in appropriate locations.

---

#### **Milestone 4: Process Historical Data**

* **Objective** : Clean, transform, and aggregate historical weather data.
* **Steps** :

1. Set up Apache Spark (locally or using a cloud service like Databricks).
2. Write PySpark jobs to:
   * Clean and normalize raw data.
   * Aggregate metrics (e.g., daily average temperature).
3. Save the processed data back to the data lake or database.

* **Deliverable** : Cleaned and aggregated historical weather data.

---

#### **Milestone 5: Implement Real-Time Processing**

* **Objective** : Calculate live metrics using real-time weather data.
* **Steps** :

1. Use Kafka Streams or Flink for real-time processing.
2. Implement computations such as:
   * Average temperature over the last hour.
   * Wind speed trends.
3. Test real-time metric generation with a small dataset.

* **Deliverable** : Real-time weather metrics available from streamed data.

---

#### **Milestone 6: Build ETL Pipelines**

* **Objective** : Automate the data pipeline using Apache Airflow.
* **Steps** :

1. Install and configure Apache Airflow.
2. Create DAGs for:
   * Extracting data from the API to Kafka or S3.
   * Transforming data using Spark.
   * Loading processed data into the database or warehouse.
3. Schedule the workflows to run periodically.
4. Test the ETL pipelines end-to-end.

* **Deliverable** : Automated ETL pipelines orchestrated by Airflow.

---

#### **Milestone 7: Set Up Data Warehouse**

* **Objective** : Create a centralized repository for analytics and queries.
* **Steps** :

1. Choose a data warehouse (e.g., Snowflake or Redshift).
2. Load cleaned and aggregated data into the warehouse.
3. Configure schema and indexing for efficient querying.
4. Test warehouse queries for performance.

* **Deliverable** : Aggregated weather data accessible via SQL in the data warehouse.

---

#### **Milestone 8: Data Visualization**

* **Objective** : Create interactive dashboards for weather insights.
* **Steps** :

1. Choose a visualization tool (e.g., Tableau, Power BI, or Apache Superset).
2. Build dashboards to:
   * Show temperature trends over time.
   * Compare weather metrics across locations.
   * Highlight extreme weather events.
3. Host the dashboards on Tableau Public or a cloud-based service.

* **Deliverable** : A live dashboard showcasing weather trends and comparisons.

---

#### **Milestone 9: Develop Machine Learning Model**

* **Objective** : Predict weather metrics using historical data.
* **Steps** :

1. Preprocess historical data for machine learning (e.g., feature scaling, handling missing values).
2. Build and train a basic ML model using scikit-learn or TensorFlow:
   * Target prediction: temperature or precipitation.
3. Evaluate the model on test data.
4. Deploy the model as a batch inference pipeline or real-time API.

* **Deliverable** : A working ML model predicting weather patterns.

---

#### **Milestone 10: Monitoring and Logging**

* **Objective** : Ensure the pipeline operates reliably.
* **Steps** :

1. Set up Prometheus and Grafana for pipeline health monitoring.
2. Configure ELK Stack for log aggregation and analysis.
3. Integrate alerts for failures or anomalies.

* **Deliverable** : A monitoring and logging framework to track pipeline performance.

---

#### **Milestone 11: CI/CD and Infrastructure Automation**

* **Objective** : Streamline deployment and scaling.
* **Steps** :

1. Write Terraform scripts for provisioning cloud resources.
2. Use Docker to containerize pipeline components.
3. Set up CI/CD workflows with GitHub Actions or Jenkins for automated deployments.

* **Deliverable** : An automated deployment pipeline for infrastructure and code.

---

#### **Milestone 12: Final Hosting and Public Deployment**

* **Objective** : Showcase the project publicly.
* **Steps** :

1. Host the dashboard on AWS (Elastic Beanstalk, EC2) or GCP.
2. Create a user-friendly frontend for the public to view weather insights.
3. Publish project documentation, including:
   * Setup instructions.
   * Architecture diagrams.
   * Use cases.

* **Deliverable** : A publicly accessible project showcasing real-time weather data insights.
