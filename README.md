# WeatherCast

Objective: Build a scalable, end-to-end data pipeline to collect, process, analyze, and visualize weather data in real time, while leveraging modern data engineering tools and techniques.

### **Project Components and Tools** :

#### 1. **Data Ingestion**

* **Source** : Use a public weather API like [OpenWeatherMap]() or [WeatherStack](https://weatherstack.com/).
* **Tools** :
  * Python scripts for API calls (`requests`, `airflow` operators).
  * Apache Kafka for real-time data streaming.
* **Frequency** : Pull weather data (temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.) every 15 minutes for multiple locations.

---

#### 2. **Data Storage**

* **Raw Data Storage** :
  * AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage (GCS) for storing raw JSON responses.
* **Database** :
  * PostgreSQL or MySQL for structured data.
  * MongoDB for semi-structured weather metadata.
* **Data Lake** :
  * Use a data lake (e.g., AWS S3 or Delta Lake) for raw and processed data.

---

#### 3. **Data Processing**

* **Batch Processing** :
  * Apache Spark (PySpark) to clean, transform, and aggregate historical data for analysis.
* **Stream Processing** :
  * Apache Kafka Streams or Apache Flink for processing real-time weather data and calculating live metrics like average temperature, wind speed, etc.

---

#### 4. **ETL Pipeline**

* **Tools** : Apache Airflow for orchestrating ETL workflows.
* **Workflow** :
  * Extract: Ingest data from API into S3 or Kafka.
  * Transform: Use PySpark/Snowflake to clean and normalize data.
  * Load: Store processed data into a relational database or warehouse (e.g., Snowflake, Redshift).

---

#### 5. **Data Warehouse**

* **Tool** :
  * Snowflake, BigQuery, or Amazon Redshift.
* **Purpose** : Store aggregated data for querying and analytics.

---

#### 6. **Data Visualization**

* **Tools** :
  * Power BI, Tableau, or Looker for dashboards.
* Visualize metrics like temperature trends, extreme weather events, and location-based comparisons.

---

#### 7. **Machine Learning (Optional)**

* Build a simple ML model to predict temperature or precipitation using historical weather data.
* Tools: Scikit-learn or TensorFlow for modeling.

---

#### 8. **Monitoring and Logging**

* **Tools** :
  * Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring pipeline health.
  * ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for logging and analytics.

---

#### 9. **CI/CD and Infrastructure Automation**

* **Tools** :
  * GitHub Actions or Jenkins for CI/CD.
  * Terraform or AWS CloudFormation for provisioning infrastructure.
  * Deploy pipeline components in Docker containers, orchestrated with Kubernetes.

---

#### 10. **Scalability**

* Use AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions for serverless components.
* Configure Kafka topics and Spark jobs to handle high throughput.

---

### **Deliverables** :

1. A scalable data pipeline that ingests, processes, and stores weather data.
2. A live dashboard showing real-time weather insights and historical trends.
3. Documentation for pipeline architecture and setup instructions.
4. Optional: A prediction model for weather forecasting.
